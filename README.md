This page is tecnically my first "real" project, or at least the first fancy one that i do without a lot of help from the course. Tbh i'm actually surprised how fun and engaging is to code, I have my hopes of becoming a good programmer in the close future so I can work from this, and after all this lessons, that goal doesn't feel so irreal anymore ;)
