        <h2>A classic sweet preparation from Argentina</h2>
        <p>The "dulce de leche" is a classic sweet made from sugar and milk. It can be used in many recipes (mostly in bakery) due to his sweet flavor and humidity.</p>
        <p>It was accidentally discovered by Juan Manuel de Rosas's servant when she left milk with sugar boiling too much time</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups milk</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1¼ cups sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together 4 cups milk, 1 1/4 cups sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until caramelized and thickened, about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours.(After about an hour, stir more often as milk caramelizes, to avoid burning.)</li>
            <li>Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla. Transfer to a bowl to cool. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.</li>
        </ol>
