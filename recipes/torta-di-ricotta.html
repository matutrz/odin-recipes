        <p>An italian classic for those of us who enjoy lemon-flavored food</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100g unsalted butter, chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (165g) caster sugar </li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>11/2 cups (225g) plain flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>450g fresh ricotta</li>
            <li>100g cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Finely grated zest of 1/2 lemon</li>
            <li>Icing sugar, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the pastry, beat butter and 1/4 cup (55g) sugar in a stand mixer until smooth and combined. Beat in 1 egg until well combined. Fold in flour, baking powder, pinch of salt flakes and 2 tsp iced water. Enclose in plastic wrap and chill for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200°C. Roll out pastry between 2 sheets of baking paper to 3mm thick. Use to line the base and side of a 22cm, loose-bottomed, fluted tart pan, trimming any excess, then freeze for 10 minutes. Line pastry with baking paper and pastry weights, place on a baking tray and bake for 20 minutes or until edges are light golden. Remove weights and paper, and bake for a further 10 minutes or until base is golden. Remove from oven and cool slightly. Reduce oven to 150°C.</li>
            <li>To make filling, beat ricotta and cream cheese in a stand mixer until smooth. Beat in vanilla, lemon zest, remaining 1/2 cup (110g) sugar and remaining 2 eggs, then pour into tart shell. Bake for 30 minutes or until pastry is golden and ricotta is set with a gentle wobble in the centre. Cool to room temperature, then chill for 2 hours. Dust with icing sugar to serve.</li>
